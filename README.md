# Get started with Firebase Genkit and IDX!

Welcome to the Firebase Genkit template!

To get started, follow the instructions that appear in the terminal window
at the bottom of your screen, including accepting the Genkit CLI terms,
updating your `package.json` and creating sample flows.

Once that initial setup is complete, you'll then see the Genkit developer
UI appear in a **Web** tab in your editor.

## Set up your Gemini API Key

From here, you'll need to update the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` environment variable
in your `.idx/dev.nix` file with a real Gemini API key.

You can use the IDX panel on the left and select **Add Gemini API** or grab
one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).

You'll need to press the **Rebuild Environment** button that appears in the
`dev.nix` editor after you've entered your API key.

## Start using Genkit

Once you're set up, try prompting Gemini models in the **Models** section of
the Genkit developer UI, or head over to the
[Firebase Genkit docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/genkit) for more.
