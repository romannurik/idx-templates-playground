## Usage notes

> [!CAUTION]
> Using the Google AI SDK directly from a client-side app as is shown in
> this sample is recommended for prototyping only. For non-prototyping use
> cases, we strongly recommend that you call the Google AI Gemini API only
> server-side to keep your API key safe. If you embed your API key directly in
> your web app or fetch it remotely at runtime, you risk potentially exposing
> your API key to malicious actors.
