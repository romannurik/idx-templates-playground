# Three.js and React Three Fiber

This is a starter template in TypeScript, for building a 3D-enabled web site with these technologies:

- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/): 3D rendering library for the web that uses WebGL.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): web app framework
- [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber): React wrapper for Three.js that makes it easy to work with 3D objects just like normal React components.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): Development server and toolchain
